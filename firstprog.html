<h3>1. What is GUI in java?</h3>

<p>Ans: GUI stands for Graphical User Interface

<h3>2. Difference between applet and GUI in java?</h3>

<p>Ans:  applet is for browsers like firefox, chrome or IE <br/>

"well, An applet is a program written in the Java programming language that can be included in an HTML page, much in the same way an image is included in a page. When you use a Java technology-enabled browser to view a page that contains an applet, the applet's code is transferred to your system and executed by the browser's Java Virtual Machine (JVM). For information and examples on how to include an applet in an HTML page, refer to this description of the APPLET> tag. 
The difference between the applet and swing is as mentioned below: <br/><br/>
1.Applets are Java programs which are capable of being run within a browser. Swing is a GUI framework. <br/>
2. Applet belongs to java.awt package and swing belongs to javax.swing.* package. <br/>
3. Applet is a heavy weight component but swing comes under light weight component's category. <br/>
4.Swing is a set of classes under JFC that provide lightweight visual component , enable creation of attractive GUI. But Applet is heavyweight component and needs web browser or tool known as AppletViewer."</p>

<P>a. import java.awt.FlowLayout;<br/>
A flow layout arranges components in a directional flow, much like lines of text in a paragraph. The flow direction is determined by the container's componentOrientation property and may be one of two values: <br/>
	ComponentOrientation.LEFT_TO_RIGHT <br/>
	ComponentOrientation.RIGHT_TO_LEFT <br/>
Flow layouts are typically used to arrange buttons in a panel. It arranges buttons horizontally until no more buttons fit on the same line. The line alignment is determined by the align property. The possible values are: <br/>
